# How to use
Download the code,
and checkout "demo.m" line 1-4 to see how to add dependencies,
then run 

`>> demo` 

in Matlab to see how to use it. 

Change parameter settings to try different datasets and policies. 
In particular, change `which_setting` to switch between budgeted or cost effective settings. 

The code is partially tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Matlab 2017b.
